# TypeScript 1st File

This file was made with the intent to get started in TypeScript

This code basically does nothing except connect to your mongodb database and display a useless message on routes `/ami` and `/`

### Even after this discouraging message for some god-f###ing reason you wanna clone this repo and run it
```
yarn run build // build .js files for running
```

```
yarn run start // starts server on 3000
```

### You will also need a `.env` file for this
```
MONGO_URI : "Your connection uri"
PORT : "alternative to port 3000"
```

#### Well yeah thats it, GOOD LUCK :wink: Bye!!! :wave::wave:
